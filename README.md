# Colour Matching Game 🎨
A Java-based colour puzzle game inspired by *I Love Hue*.
Built as a coding and design project to explore logic and interactive UI development, and have fun with beautiful colours.

Players can design their own levels by choosing the **colours of the four corners** and the **grid size**, and the game generates a gradient to solve. Currently, there is only one difficulty level, but more will be added as the project develops.

Players may also play preset levels.
